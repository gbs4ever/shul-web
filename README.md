## Installation

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
`gatsby new shul-web https://github.com/gbs4ever/shul-web.git`

Run `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start.

## CSS Grid

The grid on this site was replaced with a custom version, built using CSS Grid. It's a very simple 12 column grid that is disabled on mobile. To start using the grid, wrap the desired items with `grid-wrapper`. Items inside the `grid-wrapper` use the class `col-` followed by a number, which should add up to 12.
